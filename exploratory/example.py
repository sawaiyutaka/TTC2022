"""
In this example, we first train a random forest classifier on the dataset using the EconML package, and get the 
feature importance of each variable. Then we use the select_relevant_features function from EconML to select the top 
n important features from the dataset, based on a threshold value of 0.01. Next, we use domain knowledge to further 
refine the selected features by removing some features that are known to be irrelevant. Finally, we use the refined 
feature names to select the final features from the dataset. 

It's important to note that this is just an example and it should be adjusted and fine-tuned according to your 
problem, dataset and feature selection criteria. Also, it's a good practice to validate the feature selection process 
with an independent dataset, or by using techniques such as cross-validation, to ensure that the selected variables 
generalize well.

In this example, we first split the dataset into training and test sets, then apply SMOTE to oversample the 
minority class and RandomUnderSampler to undersample the majority class. We use the fit_resample method to fit the 
data and return the oversampled and undersampled data. Finally, we train our model on the oversampled and 
undersampled training sets and evaluate the model on the test set. 

It's important to note that this is just an example and it should be adjusted and fine-tuned according to your 
problem and dataset. Also, it's a good practice to use cross-validation and to evaluate the performance of the model 
using different performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC.
